# Module-18

For this project, I used a dataset from April 2024. While I drew inspiration from our lessons, I also utilized YouTube for additional guidance, particularly for writing code. I relied heavily on coding throughout this module. Such as the code below: 
IF [Previous Month Rides] != 0 THEN
    ([Total Rides] - [Previous Month Rides]) / [Previous Month Rides]
ELSE
    0
END
